# Test Plan Overview (DRAFT, Non-Normative)

This document sketches a potential approach to testing the configuration discovery library. It is intentionally high level and is not a final specification.

## Goals
- Verify path discovery works across scopes (env, project, workspace, user, system, registry).
- Ensure glob patterns, case handling, and symlink behavior operate consistently on Unix and Windows.
- Confirm boundary detection respects custom markers and skip/disable options.

## Components
1. **Unit tests** using a mocked filesystem (e.g., `memfs`) to isolate platform‑specific logic.
2. **Integration tests** on real filesystems for Unix, macOS, and Windows.
3. **Edge cases** such as long paths, symlink loops, and malformed environment variables.
4. **Performance checks** measuring directory traversal depth and caching effectiveness.

## Tools
- `mocha` or `vitest` for test execution.
- `glob` for pattern expansion within tests.
- Optional Windows Registry mocking for registry‑related tests.
