# Review of docs/spec.md

## Cognitive Engineering Perspective

* **Clarity and Organization**: The specification is well structured, dividing requirements into distinct sections such as search locations, file patterns, boundaries, symlink handling, return data structures, and API sketch. However, certain sections are verbose and could benefit from concise bullet points or tables to highlight defaults versus configurable options.
* **Redundancy**: "Notes" near the end repeats some material from earlier sections (standards precedence, future work, standalone discovery). Consolidating these notes with existing sections would reduce repetition.
* **Terminology**: The document alternates between "config", "configs", "directories", "dirs". Consistent terminology improves readability. Suggest picking one form for each concept (e.g., "config file", "config directory").
* **Visual Aids**: Examples are text-heavy. Simple diagrams depicting the recursive search order or the pentad structure would help new readers grasp the data flow quickly.
* **Ambiguity**: Some options (e.g., precedence configuration, skipLocations) could use short examples clarifying their effect. A small table summarizing each option with default and example usage would ease adoption.
* **Target Audience**: The spec assumes familiarity with Node.js and cross-platform conventions. Clarifying whether this is a standalone library or part of a larger system would help orient new contributors.

## Systems Engineering Notes

1. **Goals and Constraints**
   * Primary goal is discovery-only; no parsing or CLI logic. This keeps the library lightweight and reduces dependencies.
   * Support Node.js >=14 and crossâ€‘platform path handling. Consider verifying Windows compatibility early in development, as path normalization, long path support, and registry access can be subtle.
2. **Modular Design**
   * The recursive design for scopes is elegant. Ensure each scope module is independently testable. Unit tests should simulate environment variables and file system states without relying on actual user directories.
   * Consider providing an interface or dependency injection for the filesystem layer. This will simplify testing on different platforms and allow mocking.
3. **Performance Considerations**
   * The spec mentions caching `fs.stat` and parallelizing scope checks. Provide guidelines for when to evict caches or limit concurrency to avoid overwhelming slower storage (e.g., network mounts).
4. **Security and Robustness**
   * Some environments may restrict access to directories like `/etc` or registry keys. Ensure the library fails gracefully with clear error messages or warnings rather than silent skips.
   * When following symlinks, be cautious of symlink races or malicious links. Document that the caller is responsible for security when opening discovered paths.
5. **Extensibility**
   * Future work mentions registry-like systems for macOS and Linux. Designing the API around pluggable scope providers would make this easier. Each provider could implement a standard interface returning discovered paths.
   * The options interface is already broad. To avoid bloat, group related options into sub-objects (e.g., `search.locations`, `search.patterns`).
6. **Documentation Quality**
   * Provide a short quick-start section with typical usage examples. E.g., "Find config file for `myapp`" or "List all config directories". This would complement the API sketch.
   * Add references or links to standards (XDG, FHS, POSIX) so readers can learn more.

## Conclusion

Overall the specification describes a powerful and flexible discovery mechanism. Polishing the document for brevity and consistent terminology, while expanding practical examples, will make it easier for developers to understand and implement. Future iterations might extract option summaries into tables and add diagrams illustrating search order and data flow.
